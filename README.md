# 3-Degree-of-freedom-Robotic-arm
3DOF(Degree of freedom) Robotic arm contains 3 Stepper Motors,3 encoders and an arduino board to control them all.Given below are some of the codes that are useful for the robot to work on different platforms like Matlab,Simulink,GUI and Arduino IDE.

# robomatlab.m
the above code is made using matlab for running a 3DOF Robotic arm.

# pulsesteppermotor2.slx
the above Simulink block is used for running a 3DOF Robotic arm for different amount of pulses.

# square_90and0_degree.ino
the above code is made using Arduino C for running a 3DOF Robotic arm and plotting a square with it.

# 3DOF robotDlg.cpp
the above code is made using Embedded C on Visual C++ and it is used for running a 3DOF Robotic arm for different amount of pulses.
